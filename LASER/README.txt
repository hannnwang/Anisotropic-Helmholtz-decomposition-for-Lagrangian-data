Code to compute different modes of the structure functions using angle weighting, and conduct the Helmholtz decomposition. 
The main code to run is LASERrun.m., which is captioned. Other codes are not well captioned yet, but don't hestitate to contact if you are confused by something.

Important Note: as Dhruv found out, this current version contains a bug: the undrogued drifters are not actually deleted here! We are investigating the impact of this.
