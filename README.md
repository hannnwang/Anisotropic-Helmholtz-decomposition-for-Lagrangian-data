# Anisotropic-Helmholtz-decomposition-for-Lagrangian-data
Synthetic examples and data codes that conduct Helmholtz decomposition for Lagrangian data allowing for anisotropy

Corresponding to paper titled "Anisotropic statistics of Lagrangian Structure Functions and Helmholtz Decomposition", submitted to JPO. 

Contains two folders: the folder titled "Synthetic" contains the codes corresponding to the synthetic examples given in section 5 in the paper.
The folder titled "LASER" contains the codes corresponding to the LASER application presented in section 6 in paper.

The folder "Synthetic" is formatted and captioned. The folder "LASER" contains all necessary codes, but are not captioned yet. The captioning will be completed in a matter of days.
