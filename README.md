# Anisotropic-Helmholtz-decomposition-for-Lagrangian-data
Synthetic examples and data codes that conduct Helmholtz decomposition in Lagrangian data allowing for anisotropy

Corresponding to paper titled "Anisotropic statistics of Lagrangian Structure Functions and Helmholtz Decomposition", submitted to JPO. 

Contains two folders: the folder titled "Synthetic" contains the codes corresponding to the synthetic examples given in section 5 in the paper.

Synthetic examples

Contain the alternative angle weighting approach too
